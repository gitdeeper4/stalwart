# STALWART: Technical Project Description

## 1. General Definition
**STALWART** (Structural Telemetry And Load Warning Architecture for Resilient Trusses) is a Sentry-Grade system designed for continuous and precise monitoring of strategic bridges.

## 2. Scientific Problem
Current strategic bridges are managed through reactive maintenance systems, leaving a blind period between crack initiation and detection time. No existing system simultaneously collects and analyzes all seven physical indicators in real-time with precise physical analysis.

## 3. Proposed Solution
Development of an integrated platform that performs:

### 3.1 Multi-Dimensional Real-Time Monitoring
- **Strain Gauges**: Measure instantaneous deformations
- **Accelerometers**: Monitor natural frequencies and resonance
- **Acoustic Sensors**: Detect cracks through ultrasonic waves
- **Thermal Sensors**: Measure thermal gradients
- **Corrosion Sensors**: Monitor electrochemical integrity

### 3.2 Heptad Analysis Matrix
1. **Aero-Dynamic Flutter**: Analysis of aerodynamic flutter and its impact on stability
2. **Modal Resonance Shift**: Tracking changes in the bridge's natural frequencies
3. **Acoustic Stress Flux**: Measuring stress flow through acoustic waves
4. **Thermal Gradient Strain**: Calculating strains resulting from thermal differences
5. **Kinetic Load Footprint**: Analyzing moving load patterns
6. **Electrochemical Integrity**: Assessing corrosion rates and electrochemical effects
7. **Strain Energy Density (SED)**: Calculating strain energy density as a failure indicator

## 4. Methodology
- Data processing according to precise physical laws
- Comparison of indicators with pre-defined critical thresholds
- Issuance of strategic alerts when thresholds are exceeded
- Real-time adaptation to environmental conditions (salinity, humidity, currents)

## 5. Applications
- **Strategic Bridges**: Vital bridges of national importance
- **Harsh Environments**: Marine bridges and high-salinity areas
- **Submerged Bridges**: Underwater structures or flood-prone areas
- **Aging Infrastructure**: Safety assessment of bridges with advanced service life

## 6. Expected Outputs
- Functional prototype ready for testing on an experimental bridge
- Physically-validated indicator analysis algorithms
- Strategic warning interface for maintenance and emergency teams
- Complete technical documentation

## 7. Proposed Timeline
| Phase | Duration | Outputs |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Feasibility Study | 2 months | Complete requirements document |
| Prototype Development | 4 months | Working laboratory prototype |
| Laboratory Testing | 3 months | Initial results and improvements |
| Field Trial | 3 months | Final evaluation report |
